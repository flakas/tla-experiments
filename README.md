TLA Experiments
================

This is a collection of my TLA experiments in an attempt to explore and learn about usage of formal methods.

You can read more about TLA (Temporal Logic of Actions) on [Leslie Lamport's website](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html).
If you wish to learn TLA and Pluscal, a good resource is [LearnTLA.com](https://learntla.com/).
